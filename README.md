# Use of Personal Data in Software Engineering

In the article "Silicon Valley siphons our data like oil. But the deepest drilling has just begun", Ben Tarnoff discusses the use of data as a commodity by Silicon Valley.
Just as how the oil industry drill for oil and makes money off it, the tech industry collects data. Tech companies collect all sorts of data-from what items we search for
on Amazon to what post we like on Facebook. And to encourage people to stay online more, they come up with addictive apps. I found this article interesting because it
gives insight as to how tech companies are making so much money from software. As the amount of data that can be harvested is slowing down, tech companies wish to collect data offline as well. And with technology like Amazon's new Amazon's Go, Amazon can collect data in the supermarket and with Amazon Alexa, collect data in homes.

I like this article, especially because big data and data analytics are big interests of mine. I do find it interesting, if not startling, how integrated into our lives these data harvesting mechanisms are. I think the article was writen with a very apprehensive, if not slightly alarmist tone, but I do agree that there is the potential for a "take over" of our lives if data harvesting is left to the companies that make a profit off of it. On the software engineering side however, the process of data analytics, and the machine learning ideas that are connected to it, are really fun to study and implement and are a rapidly growing branch of software engineering.
